# Take-Home Task: Subscription Demo Application

## Objective:
Build a small demo web application where users can sign up, log in, and subscribe to different plans using Supabase as the backend and Next.js as the frontend.

## Requirements:

**Authentication:** Use Supabase Auth to handle user registration and login.

**Subscription Plans:** Implement at least two subscription tiers: Free and Premium. Each plan unlocks different content/features.

**User Dashboard:** After login, users should see their subscription status and available features.

**Plan Upgrade:** Users should be able to upgrade their subscription (simulated without real payment for the demo).

## Database: 

Use Supabase tables to store:

- Users

- Subscription plans

- User subscriptions

## Frontend: 
Use Next.js for pages like Home, Login, Dashboard, and Subscription.

## Deliverables:

Fully functional demo on GitHub (with clear README).
